## A Journey Through Our Inception

### Our (Re)Conception

The initiative to revive dharavi.org, a website initially launched by Urbz in 2008, emerged as a collaborative effort between students of EfSI 2023 and urbz. Their shared objective was to create a platform that would present Dharavi in a unique way to a global audience. Through constructive discussions between the Urbz team and the participating students, a set of principles was drafted to define the essential aspects of the site's operation.

These principles of operating the site can be divided into two main categories: **the necessary technology** to ensure the site's functionality and **the type of content** to be hosted.

Regarding the technology aspect, an in-depth exploration into the reasons behind the former dharavi.org website's inactivity revealed the need for a content management system that could guarantee the site's longevity and enable easy archiving of associated data. To meet these requirements, the team selected [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) due to its flat-file architecture, which eliminates the need for maintaining a database. Grav also allows content to be written in markdown and seamlessly rendered into HTML pages, while keeping server requirements relatively simple.

To address content-related challenges, the conversations centered around minimizing the need for intervention in order to maintain site functionality. As a result, certain features like discussion threads, despite their participatory nature, were considered impractical due to the ongoing moderation they would demand. Consequently, the decision was made to transfer active discussions to a separate site, ideally with self-regulation by users. 

The site's content was classified into two distinct categories: active content and archive content. The key distinction between these categories lay in their treatment and maintenance. Active content required periodic updates, ensuring its relevance over time, while archive content was intended for one-time uploading and could remain untouched thereafter.

### The Emerging Conversation

With a clear understanding of the content to be hosted on the site, a concerted effort was initiated to explore the types of content that would be captivating and influential enough to catalyze a significant shift in the narrative surrounding Dharavi. It was evident that prevailing viewpoints on Dharavi often oscillated between two extremes: either advocating for redevelopment without adequately considering the local community or maintaining the status quo due to apprehensions about disrupting the lives of residents. Recognizing that the optimal solution lay somewhere in between, it became apparent that a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach, drawing upon a diverse range of knowledge from multiple fields, would be necessary to unravel the true answer.

Striving to strike a delicate balance between the weight of historical context accompanying this project and the desire to embark on a fresh and distinctive approach, it was determined that a journal format would be the most suitable type of active content to be hosted on the site. This realization stemmed from the observation that, despite the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of Dharavi's inner workings, its overarching external perception exhibited a slower cycle of change, often influenced by external factors induced by the government. The endeavor of constantly keeping up with instantaneous events unfolding on the ground would contradict the principle of minimal intervention necessary for site operation. Consequently, the decision to publish a quarterly journal emerged as a favorable choice.

To enhance the website's comprehensiveness, it was decided to incorporate a curated collection of resources and initiatives, forming a rich tapestry of knowledge and insights about Dharavi and the greater Mumbai area. This diverse range of content aimed to establish a foundational understanding that individuals could internalize. The curated resources encompassed various elements, including an archive of posts from a blog administered by Rahul and Matias from Urbz. Additionally, the collection encompassed a comprehensive list of local organizations, books, movies, and even academic papers. The intention was to offer a broad spectrum of resources, enabling visitors to familiarize themselves with the contextual landscape within which Dharavi exists and operates. Moreover, these resources also provided glimpses of perspectives from different geographical locations, enriching the overall understanding of Dharavi's intricate dynamics.

### The Journal

The final component of dharavi.org, the journal, serves as a dynamic platform that invites unconventional and interdisciplinary perspectives on the future of Dharavi, transcending the boundaries of current discourse. It actively seeks opinions, proposals, and perspectives that may appear extraordinary, yet firmly grounded in reality. The objective is to establish a new knowledge base that addresses the question of Dharavi's future, free from the long-standing contention among various stakeholders. Through this endeavor, our aim is to present Dharavi in a unique light, showcasing alternative proposals for its transformation.

In a broader context, we aspire to illustrate how this body of knowledge extends beyond the discussion of Dharavi's future, shedding light on marginalized and excluded societies worldwide. While the process of generating content may involve reaching out to individuals with intriguing perspectives, the platform remains open to public submissions, provided they adhere to a set of editorial guidelines.

These editorial guidelines serve as a mechanism to curate high-quality, engaging content. While we are open to reviewing submissions and collaborating with authors to enhance their work for our readers, it is important to acknowledge that our resources are limited, and we may not be able to accommodate every submission within our capacity. Nevertheless, we are dedicated to our unwavering commitment: to curate an engaging and thought-provoking collection of perspectives envisioning an alternate and extraordinary future for Dharavi.
