The NYU Abu Dhabi Engineers for Social Impact program works develop a broad range of analytical and systematic thinking skills in students as they work with communities and consider the home-grown assets that can lead to innovation.

In 2023, a collaboration unfolded between a group of NYU Abu Dhabi students and urbz, an action and research collective specialized in  participatory urban planning and design. With the support of urbz, the student collective embarked on a journey to reimagine the community of Dharavi. The primary goal was to connect to a process and embark on an informed journey to create projects that have a lasting change driven by active public engagement.

Here's are the resulting three projects:

## [DHARAVI.ORG](dharavi-org)

**Dharavi.org** seeks to launch a platform that fosters discussion and exchange, in order to develop a comprehensive strategy and theory that challenges traditional notions of urban development. Framed as a journal in the pursuit of promoting a radical new approach to urban development in Dharavi, the discourse around innovative and transformative ideas is paramount. Our goal is to introduce fresh and dynamic home grown concepts that break from convention, in both the Global South and North. We believe that this is a moment for visionary thinking and pushing boundaries in order to pave the way for real and lasting change.
 
## [KOLIWADA PIPES](koliwada-pipeline)

Sounding rockets are commonly used to carry instruments that take readings from 50 kilometers (31 mi) to 1,500 kilometers (930 mi) above the surface of the Earth.[27] The first images of Earth from space were obtained from a V-2 rocket in 1946 (flight #13).[28]

Rocket engines are also used to propel rocket sleds along a rail at extremely high speed. The world record for this is Mach 8.5.[29]

Larger rockets are normally launched from a launch pad that provides stable support until a few seconds after ignition. Due to their high exhaust velocity—2,500 to 4,500 m/s (9,000 to 16,200 km/h; 5,600 to 10,100 mph)—rockets are particularly useful when very high speeds are required, such as orbital speed at approximately 7,800 m/s (28,000 km/h; 17,000 mph). Spacecraft delivered into orbital trajectories become artificial satellites, which are used for many commercial purposes. Indeed, rockets remain the only way to launch spacecraft into orbit and beyond.[30] They are also used to rapidly accelerate spacecraft when they change orbits or de-orbit for landing. Also, a rocket may be used to soften a hard parachute landing immediately before touchdown (see retrorocket).
