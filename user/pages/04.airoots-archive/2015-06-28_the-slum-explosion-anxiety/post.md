The article discusses global anxieties about population growth and the housing crisis, arguing that the fear of slums and the inability to provide affordable housing stem from faulty policies and a lack of imagination rather than the actual capacity to house people. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the factors contributing to the urban crisis, such as land arrangements and speculation, in order to address the issue effectively.

===

Global anxieties about population growth have been around at least since Malthus, with a peak
in the 1960s when American academics started talking about a “population bomb” that would
throw the rich world right back into poverty -and annihilate India once and for all. The particular
shape of that anxiety in the form of a housing crisis set to swamp the world is relatively more
recent. We seem to now firmly believe that population growth will overtake the capacity of
governments to house people at decent standards. Subsequently, the world will get slummed up
beyond redemption. There is a prophet of doom – à la Mike Davis – for every urban crisis that
we face in different parts of the world.

However the apocalyptic vision itself has a narrative thrust. In it, greed and fear dominate over
humanity and creativity. It calls for drastic and swift responses. Our fear is that, unfortunately,
these responses may actually be more catastrophic than the reality they wish to contain.
We believe that the most urgent thing we must do is step away from such anxieties as a starting
point, while looking precisely at the factors that cause them. While we definitely must analyze
why more and more people are getting constituted as the surplus humanity which modern urban
administrations seem to have given up on, we need to look at the pressure points afresh. We
simply don’t see the weak joints where others seem to– basically the dark horizons of
megalopolises being invaded by multitudinous migrants – moving in hordes across national or
rural-urban borders.

We believe that the preponderance of slums in a global landscape that continues to urbanize
rapidly, is a legacy of faulty policy and worse – a lack of imagination about what makes for good
cities. It is also a lack of memory about how slums have always been part and parcel of
urbanization and the many ways in which they have been integrated in cities throughout history.
Architectural and planning professions and other urban commentators have an amazing
capacity to forget how so many of the neighbourhoods that we love have gone through many
stages of development before becoming what they are. Many of the quarters of New York, Paris,
London or Tokyo were once slums, by any contemporary standards.

It is our contention that the inability of incremental housing in cities like Mumbai, Rio or Nairobi
to translate into a successful tool of urban transformation is due to factors other than its intrinsic
merit or fault. The issue of affordable housing is a problem not because there are simply too
many people lacking resources or means to find or make decent homes and neighbourhoods,
but that there are a handful of people who refuse to see cities and habitats in any other way but
as a place of fixed and limited choices.

Around eight years ago, we set up a small office in the famed and notorious so-called ‘slum’ of
Dharavi. In the global map of slums, we placed ourselves at the epicentre of what was
mistakenly referred to as the largest such settlement in Asia. We were the latest entrants in a
field that was populated by activists, NGO’s, political parties and other do-gooders and got
absorbed in heated waves of discussion, debate and dissent. The government’s redevelopment
plan, originally master-minded by a New Jersey consultant of Indian origin, was slated to
become a single point clearance agenda for redeveloping this neighbourhood.

We interacted with Mumbai’s diverse set of activists and citizens with more diverse viewpoints
and ideological moorings. And even where there was an overlap, we often found ourselves
saying things that were counter-intuitive. Those conversations helped us sharpen our
conviction more than ever, and over the next few years, we found ourselves being immersed in
the practice of incremental development strategies in Mumbai. We have since then resettled our
office in Shivaji Nagar, Govandi – a settlement which is not as much in the limelight as Dharavi,
but which is struggling just as much to reinvent itself.

We worked with local community leaders, with local house builders, residents and children and
began to understand what community and neighbourhood life in a ‘slum’ was all about. All
through the years, what we saw seemed to be some kind of real-time unfolding of incremental
development strategies – the way we had read about them, or quickly glimpsed in Latin
American contexts. Our practice sharpened, convictions became firmer and communication
became smoother as we started conversing more confidently.

We had started our journeys in diverse, overlapping and occasionally parallel worlds. Our
practice became a mashup of urban planning, anthropology, economics, architecture and
design. Our ideological make up reflected all the unacknowledged intellectual confusion and
fierce ethical commitment that our generation had grappled with thanks to the tectonic shifts of
national and political maps since the 90s.

We attempted to connect our practice in Mumbai to a larger set of conversations that happened
as we found ourselves travelling to Tokyo, Barcelona, Geneva, Sao Paulo, Rio, New York,
Istanbul, Perugia, Milan, Shenzen, Belgrade, Johahhnesburg – wherever we went we found
ourselves making linkages to the city and coming back to familiar practices – which somehow or
the other involved watching people make their homes and lives over a generation, creating
bonds with each other, sculpting communities from basic human needs of co-dependency and
good-naturedness. We found a bit of Mumbai everywhere in the world.

And the people who we encountered through these journeys – our colleagues, our supporters,
our collaborators, our critics and intellectual comrades – were the real touchstones of
transformative learning. They all helped shape our central argument that connects our work:
Human beings as productive agents have the collective capacity to create their own built environments. If their environments are degraded in any way – that is to say if they happen to be slums – this state of affairs is connected to a set of factors that has little to do with their
capacity or ability to create quality built environments. These factors include land arrangements
that do not recognize occupancy rights as a valid mode of living in a city. They also include
legislation that prohibits them to improve their environment because that would mean
developing a sense of ownership towards the land on which they exist.

This is not allowed simply because cities today are shaped by speculation on land and space
which is so tied down to its exchange value that it becomes out of reach for most of its
residents. Especially those who find it more economical to use it for productive means. And it
has to be deliberately kept out of reach as only then would the exchange value become
genuinely lucrative. Due to this, civic authorities refuse to acknowledge that the city’s workers
and the poor who contribute to its economy, need a different regime of occupying urban space,
one which is based on use-value.

It is in this state of affairs – more than anything else that the urban crisis of today is predicated
and this is what needs to be unpacked and understood – in the greatest of detail possible.
