    title:
        text: 'A Journal Against The Current'
    content: 'The perception of Dharavi''s future is often oversimplified, limited to hasty redevelopment or complete disregard. We embrace a broader spectrum of possibilities. As an interdisciplinary journal, we explore perspectives beyond this narrow duality, showcasing innovative proposals and strategies for redevelopment that are both extraordinary and firmly grounded in reality.'
