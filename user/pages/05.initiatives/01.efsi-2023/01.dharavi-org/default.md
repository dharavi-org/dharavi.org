## Our Mission

The future of Dharavi is at a crucial crossroads, and we believe that it's time for bold action and visionary thinking to shape the path ahead. That's why we at Dharavi.org are launching a platform for comprehensive discussion and exchange, aimed at developing a radical new approach to urban development that challenges traditional notions and fosters lasting change.

Our goal is to promote a journal that serves as a forum for fresh and dynamic ideas from both the Global South and North, providing a space for discourse around innovative and transformative concepts. By introducing home-grown ideas that break from convention, we aim to create a comprehensive strategy and theory that lays the foundation for a better future for Dharavi.

We understand that this is no easy task, but we believe that the stakes are high, and the need for change is urgent. With our platform, we hope to bring together a diverse range of voices to drive the discussion forward, paving the way for real and lasting change in Dharavi.
