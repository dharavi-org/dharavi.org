### Introduction

Dharavi is a suburb located in the heart of Mumbai, India. It is known as one of the largest slums in Asia, with an estimated population of around one million people [1]. It is densely populated, with cramped living conditions and limited access to basic amenities such as clean water, sanitation, and healthcare. The lack of proper sanitation facilities and infrastructure means that the area is prone to outbreaks of water-borne diseases, which can have a significant impact on the health and well-being of residents.

Despite its reputation as a slum and poor living conditions, Dharavi is also known for its vibrant community and entrepreneurial spirit. The area is home to a large number of small businesses, including textile factories, leather tanneries, and recycling centers [2]. These industries form a thriving informal economy, composed of seasonal immigrant workers and local residents. The leather industry alone is said to generate an estimated  $1 billion in revenue annually [2]. Many of these businesses that make up these industries operate in small, cramped spaces, often with minimal safety equipment and ventilation. Workers face a range of challenges, such as low wages, poor working and living conditions, and lack of access to social protections.

There are efforts to improve the living conditions in Dharavi. The Dharavi Redevelopment Project is an ongoing government-led initiative aimed at transforming the Dharavi area of Mumbai, India. The project was first proposed in the early 2000s and has been the subject of ongoing debate and controversy. While the goal of the project is to replace the existing slum housing in Dharavi with modern, high-rise buildings and to provide better infrastructure and amenities for residents, the controversy around the project focuses on the lack of success and the uprooting of the slum residents who do not want to lose their homes and businesses. Discussion around the redevelopment project has recently peaked due to the prominent Adani group winning a bid to be the contractor for the project [3].

For our Engineering for Social Impact (EfSI) trip, we visited Mumbai with the situation of the redevelopment project in mind and tried to find out more about how it would affect the community, and how our projects could contribute to the community and have an impact without being rendered moot by the redevelopment project. In Mumbai, Urbz led the EfSI workshop and we worked daily out of their office in the Dharavi Koliwada.

The Dharavi Koliwada where the Urbz office is located was originally founded as a fishing settlement. It is one of the oldest fishing villages in the city and has a rich cultural heritage. While it started off as a fishing village, the Koliwada is now home to a wide variety of people, from residents whose families have occupied the Koliwada for generations to seasonal migrant workers who drive the industry of Dharavi.

The Koliwada, while in Dharavi, is apparently not technically considered a part of the slum. Thus, residents do not concern themselves with the redevelopment project and are free to take on their own projects to improve life in the Koliwada. The Koliwada PIPES project is one such project, proposed by one of the residents in the Koliwada to Urbz, who have taken on the project. On our EfSI workshop trip, our group took an interest in this project and have since worked on making this project into a reality.

### Dominick Koli

We initially learned of this project from Urbz on our first day of interviews. The project started with a proposal from Dominick Koli, the president of the Koli Jamat. He proposed a 6-inch diameter pipeline system for distributing water to households within the Dharavi Koliwada. His intention was for this project to solve the issue of messy piping throughout the Koliwada: residents would pay to construct their own piping for water directly to their houses from the Dharavi main road, which resulted in a disorganized piping system where it’s hard to perform any maintenance work. 

Repeated additions of pipes to the already chaotic system because of new tenants not only worsens the issue, but also results in another issue: the rising of the street elevation level. Whenever new pipes are being installed, as other pipes of old residents are already there, those installing the new pipe cannot dig deep enough. So, the shallow laying of the new pipes is instead compensated for by raising the street level.  We saw the issue this caused for residents in some of the older buildings, where they couldn’t raise their building floor to match the street elevation.

After Dominick proposed this project, Jai Bhadghaonkar of Urbz took the lead on it. We went around the Dharavi Koliwada with Jai and Dominick to observe the current state of the piping system and learn how it is implemented, and to come up with ideas to bring Dominick’s proposal to life.

As we went around with Jai and Dominick, we observed various issues: the open drainage system created an unsanitary environment, with sewage seemingly being sucked into drinking water pipes at points (due to holes in the pipes and a lack of maintenance). This incident also put the drainage issues in Koliwada on our radar and the purpose of the project became more apparent.

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 3 : Open sewage and water supply pipes in close proximity</p>

We also observed how service pipes are connected to homes. Dominick explained how Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the government entity responsible for distribution of water (and several other things, such as drainage), implements the water distribution system. Depending on what distribution line the service pipes are connected to, the time that water is supplied to a household varies. Generally, there is a morning line and an evening line—households typically choose one line and can only collect and store water during the time that water is flowing through the line.  

![Figure 4 : Service piping to Dominick’s house](image8.png?classes=shadow-2xl,w-5/6,mx-auto)
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 4 : Service piping to Dominick’s house</p>

This is how we learned about the intermittent water supply system prevalent throughout India: water is extracted and treated, and stored in reservoirs and provided to consumers at set times. This results in some issues, such as corrosion in the pipes which means more maintenance is needed. This is a larger issue we cannot do anything about, so we can only make use of the benefits of the system (for example, attempt to plan the timeline of our pipe construction around these intermittent water supply times, although it later became clear to us that due to the long amount of time installation and connection of the pipeline would take, this apparent advantage provided by the intermittent water supply does not matter here.)

### Ethnography Work & Mapping

Initially, Dominick gave us a rough map of the main lanes. Since the structure of Dharavi changes so much over time, a lot of the structures on the map were not accurate to what we were seeing. Therefore we decided to try and get as accurate maps as we could while we were there. The original map did not align with what we saw while walking. Due to this, we created a rough walking map (figure 3) superimposed on the original map. This map has notes, names of the lanes, and fixes that we saw while walking on Dharavi main road. 

![Figure 6: Jai’s Map](image6.jpg?classes=shadow-2xl,w-5/6,mx-auto)
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 6: Jai’s Map</p>

We made a map (figure 4) by walking out the lanes and dropping geo tags at specific locations and points along the lanes. While doing this we conducted interviews with residents along the lanes (marked in figure 4) to learn more about the problems they are facing. Here are a few of the quotes from those interviews: 

1. > Along with paying water tax, we also have to pay from our pocket to get clean water regularly. <cite>- Resident on Lane 2</cite>

2. > The water is safe, there’s no need to change the water system. <cite>- Resident on Lane 4</cite>

3. > I don’t get water when the pressure is low. <cite>- Resident on Lane 8</cite>

The conflicting statements from the residents shows the disparity of water quality across Koliwada. After talking to the residents, we realized that this project is very much a social issue as well, so we decided to make something for the people to keep them informed which will be mentioned more about later on in this report. 

![Figure 7: Our Google Map](image7.png?classes=shadow-2xl,w-5/6,mx-auto)
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 7: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1X0elSg6G1_vTOi-31H0hF-BJk5gP6k8&ll=19.047146436550833%2C72.85419209999996&z=18">Our Google Map</a></p>

Once back on campus, we decided to focus on getting the elevation data for the lanes to determine the sizing of the pipes, connection points, and potential areas of bottleneck. We created a map of the lane elevation as shown by figure 5. Unfortunately, we found that the online data was not accurate, so we shifted to making an optimization map of the lanes that would connect to certain pipes. 

![Figure 8: Our Google Map with Elevation Data](image9.png?classes=shadow-2xl,w-5/6,mx-auto)
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 8: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1pKlM_rgelDOA9ztpy8dewcBlQCl7GtI&ll=19.04776248150461%2C72.85466648892019&z=20">Our Google Map with Elevation Data</a></p>

Before creating the optimized map, we received more accurate mapping from Urbz as shown by figure 6. This map includes new plans for sublanes to include the 6” pipes as well. We overlaid potential sections on this map to optimize the water supply. This was done by looking at which keys and main pipe is closest to the residence.

### Feedback From URBZ

Upon arriving back, we focused mainly on creating a proposal for the Koli Jamat to present to the BMC. There was a lot of back and forth between our team and Urbz with many logistical questions about construction, materials, elevation data, etc. With many missing holes and conflicting information, we decided to focus on creating a foundation for the project to be built on. 

This foundation started with collecting logistical information from the government regarding construction procedures and suitable materials. We were then told to create an elevation map based on  Geographic Information System (GIS) data. After creating the map, we realized that the data is not entirely accurate and that our method of measuring was not to the same relative point as Urbz. Therefore, we were told to make a tentative optimization map to show which areas should connect to what point on the main pipe.

### Our Goals

When given the feedback from Urbz, we set main and extended goals that we wanted to work on if time allowed (or to identify tasks and issues future students could work on).

Our main goals could be split into two categories: first, to further the project itself and assist in its realization. To this end, we decided to draft a project proposal to the BMC using our own research and details from Urbz, so that we could then give this proposal draft to Urbz and they could adjust it as needed before submitting the proposal to the BMC. For the proposal, we wanted to include a review of potential pipe materials and specifications and construction processes, and along with these technical details, we also wanted to include a general approach of how the project should be implemented.

Our second main goal was to raise awareness about the issues with the water system among the residents of the Koliwada and what benefits this project will bring. To achieve this, we decided to design a flyer where we’d include all the information we have on the project to keep residents informed. Since the flyer is for the community, we decided to include Hindi translations and potentially Marathi translations as well, and work closely with Urbz as they are our link to the community.

### Research & Proposal

As we worked on the project, we did research to find information to include in the proposal and also to have a better understanding of how pipeline and water distribution projects are carried out. One thing we were concerned about early on were some of the social implications of the proposed project: since many people used their own money to tap into the main pipe to get water for their household, they might take issue with the new piping that might uproot their piping work and potentially get them into trouble for unauthorized pipe laying. 

Additionally, we were also worried about whether BMC would want a population estimate to know how many people this project would benefit, and this might be an issue for unauthorized residents in the Koliwada. Lastly, we were also unsure of who would be in charge of maintenance and upkeep of the system.

Throughout our project, we stayed in close communication with Urbz and especially with Jai who was spearheading the project. They helped us think through these issues. Jai mentioned that the previous piping that already exists from residents could be used as service piping to connect from the 6-inch pipeline to people’s homes.  For the BMC report, we could work with official population numbers if needed, so we also wouldn’t need to worry about unauthorized residents being endangered. 

As for maintenance and upkeep, the Koli Jamat could be responsible. Since Dominick, who proposed the project, heads the Koli Jamat, it should be their responsibility to ensure that the project succeeds and that residents have no issues with it. So the budget of the Koli Jamat (which residents are assumed to contribute to) should cover any costs associated with the project, and a member of the Koli Jamat should be designated as a contact person (who would be listed on our designed flyer) for information or concerns related to the project.

We looked into information on pipe materials and construction processes for the report. We found that there was much more to pipe laying and piping projects than we initially thought: there were a multitude of options for pipe materials and construction processes, and there were other issues we had not even considered, such as joining together pipelines of different sizes.

As we did research on pipe materials, we looked into common materials in local pipes such as Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) and Galvanized Iron (GI). We considered several factors such as durability, safety for residents, and cost. We did the same for construction processes (including jointing of pipes), and we included all our information in the report, along with our recommendations for what options are optimal. 

We also came up with a post-construction checklist to include in our proposal to ensure that residents receive safe water and that the piping system has no issues and is properly looked after. 

For the proposal, we also wanted to include cost estimates, but we were not able to get accurate or reliable estimates, so we have provided a template for a Bill of Quantities (BoQ) to include all cost estimates for the project and have provided this to Urbz to fill out with the information they gather.

Finally, we’ve also included a sample construction timeline for one pipe lane in our BMC proposal. This timeline tackles the different stages of the project, such as planning, material procurement, excavation, pipe installation, restoration, and testing. We’ve tried to estimate what impact each stage of the project will have on residents. This BMC proposal drafted for Urbz to review and use to propose the project to the BMC is included in the appendix.

Many things shifted around since the start of the project, so we decided with the following as final deliverables: a tentative proposal to the BMC, an informational flyer for the residents, a more detailed online flyer, and rough elevation and optimization maps. All of which are included in the appendix.

### Future Project Expansions

Since Dharavi is so rapidly changing, it is hard to get accurate information to build a proposal that will be submitted in the future. As it  gets closer to the time of construction, final data needs to be added to the BoQ for measurements and the construction timeline. Additionally, an alternative water source needs to be established for residents during construction.

After the issue of drinkable water is fixed, we would like future groups to focus on the issue of sewage and drainage in Dharavi, specifically the Koliwada community. This is the largest issue facing the people and greatly impacts their lives. Being a country that has monsoon seasons, it is imperative that proper sewage/drainage systems are implemented to limit the amount of flooding and damage that is done to people.
