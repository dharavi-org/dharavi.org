In 2023, a collaboration unfolded between a group of NYU Abu Dhabi students and urbz, an action and research collective specialized in â€¨participatory urban planning and design. With the support of urbz, the student collective embarked on a journey to reimagine the community of Dharavi. The primary goal was to connect to a process and embark on an informed journey to create projects that have a lasting change driven by active public engagement.

Here's are the resulting three projects:

## [dharavi.org](dharavi-org)

**dharavi.org** seeks to launch a platform that fosters discussion and exchange, in order to develop a comprehensive strategy and theory that challenges traditional notions of urban development. Framed as a journal in the pursuit of promoting a radical new approach to urban development in Dharavi, the discourse around innovative and transformative ideas is paramount. Our goal is to introduce fresh and dynamic home grown concepts that break from convention, in both the Global South and North. We believe that this is a moment for visionary thinking and pushing boundaries in order to pave the way for real and lasting change.
 
## [Koliwada PIPES](koliwada-pipeline)

Dharavi, located in Mumbai, India, is a densely populated area facing numerous challenges, including limited access to clean water and inadequate sanitation. The Koli Jamat has proposed a solution to these problems by introducing a network of "distribution mains." These 6-inch pipes would replace individual unauthorized connections, allowing residents to connect their existing consumer connections directly. This project aims to address water contamination, maintenance costs, and other issues. Read more to learn about this transformative initiative.

## [Empowering The Women of Dharavi](women-of-dharavi)

This project in Dharavi, Mumbai focuses on providing affordable childcare options and coding education to address challenges faced by women and children. By collaborating with local organizations and community leaders, the project aims to create sustainable solutions and break the cycle of poverty. It aims to empower residents by offering reliable childcare and opportunities to develop valuable digital skills.
