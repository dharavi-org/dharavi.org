In 2023, a collaboration unfolded between a group of NYU Abu Dhabi students and urbz, an action and research collective specialized in  participatory urban planning and design. With the support of urbz, the student collective embarked on a journey to reimagine the community of Dharavi. The primary goal was to connect to a process and embark on an informed journey to create projects that have a lasting change driven by active public engagement.

Here's are the resulting three projects:

## [dharavi.org](dharavi-org)

**dharavi.org** seeks to launch a platform that fosters discussion and exchange, in order to develop a comprehensive strategy and theory that challenges traditional notions of urban development. Framed as a journal in the pursuit of promoting a radical new approach to urban development in Dharavi, the discourse around innovative and transformative ideas is paramount. Our goal is to introduce fresh and dynamic home grown concepts that break from convention, in both the Global South and North. We believe that this is a moment for visionary thinking and pushing boundaries in order to pave the way for real and lasting change.
 
## [Koliwada PIPES](koliwada-pipeline)

The Koli Jamat has proposed a new solution to tapping into the main pipe on Dharavi main road. Instead of residents having to pay for individual unauthorized connections to the main pipe, the project proposes multiple 6 inch pipes called “distribution mains” to run through various lanes in Dharavi Koliwada. These distribution mains will allow for residents current 1 "consumer connections" to connect directly into it. This will limit many different issues that residents are currently facing such as water contamination, cost of maintenance, and more. Please read more to find out about the project. 

## [Empowering The Women of Dharavi](women-of-dharavi)

Larger rockets are normally launched from a launch pad that provides stable support until a few seconds after ignition. Due to their high exhaust velocity—2,500 to 4,500 m/s (9,000 to 16,200 km/h; 5,600 to 10,100 mph)—rockets are particularly useful when very high speeds are required, such as orbital speed at approximately 7,800 m/s (28,000 km/h; 17,000 mph). Spacecraft delivered into orbital trajectories become artificial satellites, which are used for many commercial purposes. Indeed, rockets remain the only way to launch spacecraft into orbit and beyond.[30] They are also used to rapidly accelerate spacecraft when they change orbits or de-orbit for landing. Also, a rocket may be used to soften a hard parachute landing immediately before touchdown (see retrorocket).
