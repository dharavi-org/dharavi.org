### Background

Dharavi is a densely populated area located in the heart of Mumbai, India. With over one million people living in an area of just 2.5 square kilometers, Dharavi is one of the largest slums in the world. The majority of the population in Dharavi are migrants from other parts of India who have come to Mumbai in search of better job opportunities and a higher standard of living. Unfortunately, women in Dharavi face numerous challenges due to their gender and the lack of resources available to them. Poverty is a major issue in the area, with many families struggling to make ends meet. This poverty is often compounded by the fact that women have limited access to education and healthcare, which can further hinder their ability to earn a living or provide for their families.

One major challenge that women in Dharavi face is the lack of affordable and accessible childcare options. Without reliable childcare, women are often unable to work outside the home, which can limit their ability to earn a living and provide for their families. In addition, their children may miss out on important early childhood education and development opportunities.

Another challenge that women in Dharavi face is the lack of digital skills among their children. As the job market becomes increasingly reliant on technology and digital literacy, it is important for children to develop these skills early on in life. Without access to computers or coding education, children in Dharavi may struggle to compete for jobs in the future.

To address these challenges, this project aims to provide accessible childcare services and coding education to children in the area. By offering reliable and affordable childcare options, women will be better able to work outside the home and provide for their families. And by providing coding education to children, they will have the opportunity to develop valuable digital skills that can help them succeed in the job market. Through this project, women and children in Dharavi will have access to resources and opportunities that can help break the cycle of poverty and provide a pathway to a brighter future.

### Project Description

#### A. Affordable and Accessible Childcare Options:

The project aims to provide affordable and accessible childcare options to women in Dharavi. We plan to collaborate with existing daycare centers in the area, which will provide a safe and stimulating environment for children. The coding curriculum will be provided to the individuals running said centers, requiring minimal instructor effort, as the syllabus created (available in shared drive) is designed for independent student usage on an app. By offering reliable childcare options, women will be able to work outside the home and provide for their families without worrying about the safety and well-being of their children.

#### B. Digital Skills Education for Children:

Another key component of the project is teaching digital skills to children. We will provide coding education to children aged 5-8 years old using ScratchJr, a visual programming language for young children. ScratchJr is designed to help young children develop computational thinking skills and creativity. The online curriculum we will use (Robotics Era Tutorials) will be in Hindi, culturally appropriate, and relevant to the children's lives. The curriculum will cover basic coding concepts and logic and should be entertaining enough to keep children engaged and motivated.


#### C. Collaboration with Local Organizations and Community Leaders:

To ensure the success of the project, we will partner with local organizations and community leaders in Dharavi. These partnerships will help us identify women who need childcare and promote the benefits of daycare centers and coding education. We will also recruit and train local women to work as caregivers in the daycare centers, providing them with job opportunities and income. By working closely with the community, we hope to create a sustainable model that can continue to support women and children in Dharavi even after the project ends.

#### D. Current Landscape:

When it comes to the current landscape, the interviews conducted (accessible on the shared drive) have demonstrated a valid need for improved childcare services in the area. While such services exist to some extent, they are often outside the price range of the average consumer, and can be rather simplistic. Mothers have complained about how a childcare service ought to have an educational aspect. As such, the aim behind this project is to provide a curriculum for childcare centers to help maintain the interest of the children, while also ensuring they are learning. Coding was chosen as it is a desirable skill that is popular in India, but unfortunately not as popular within Dharavi. As such, this project aims at tackling two birds in one stone, improving childcare in Dharavi, and introducing a stronger coding scene to the youth.

#### E. Why Scratchjr?

1. App format is more accessible: ScratchJr is designed as a mobile application that can be easily downloaded and used on tablets or smartphones, making it more accessible to children who may not have access to a desktop or laptop computer. This also means that children can use the app on the go or outside of the classroom setting.
2. Robotics Era ScratchJr - Hindi Tutorial Already Available Online - 17 different tutorials: ScratchJr has a strong community of users and educators who have created tutorials and resources in different languages, including Hindi. These tutorials help to make ScratchJr more accessible to children who speak different languages and may not have access to English-language resources. The 17 different tutorials provide a range of learning resources for educators and children to learn the basics of ScratchJr.
3. Visual platform is shown to be better for children in the desired age range (childcare solution): ScratchJr is a visual programming platform that uses block-based coding to teach children the basics of programming. The visual platform is designed to be more engaging and intuitive for younger children, allowing them to learn at their own pace and explore their creativity through programming. Research has shown that visual programming platforms are more effective for teaching younger children as they can better understand and relate to the visual elements.
4. Research-backed - similar projects initiated in schools in Europe (Romania, Germany, Finland, Estonia), all suggesting success: ScratchJr is based on the same principles as Scratch, a popular visual programming language used in schools and universities around the world. ScratchJr is specifically designed for younger children, and its effectiveness has been backed by research studies and similar projects initiated in schools in Europe. These projects have shown that ScratchJr is an effective tool for teaching programming and computational thinking skills to children in the desired age range.
5. The age range is younger (5-7), so better: ScratchJr is designed for children aged 5-7, which is an age range where children are more receptive to learning new skills and exploring their creativity. By introducing children to programming at a younger age, they can develop important computational thinking skills that will serve them well in later life. Additionally, ScratchJr is specifically designed to be age-appropriate, with its user interface and visual elements tailored to the needs of younger children. 

### Support and Assistance

To support the children in the coding class, we will be using volunteers from our university who have expertise in coding and education. These volunteers will play a crucial role in supporting the children and ensuring they receive a high-quality learning experience, even though they will be volunteering remotely.

Volunteers will be recruited through outreach efforts on campus and through partnerships with student groups, including computer science and education organizations. Volunteers will be required to complete an orientation and training program, which will be conducted online and will include an overview of the course curriculum, teaching strategies for working with children, and guidance on cultural sensitivity.

Volunteers will be paired with small groups of children to work on coding projects together. They will interact with the children using online platforms, such as Zoom or Google Meet, and will be responsible for answering questions, providing feedback, and offering support as needed. Volunteers will be encouraged to develop positive relationships with the children and to serve as role models for them, even if they are not able to meet in person.

To ensure consistency and quality in the learning experience, volunteers will receive ongoing support and supervision from the course facilitator. Regular check-ins will be scheduled to provide feedback and address any concerns. Volunteers will be provided with resources, including videos and tutorials, to help them support the children and to ensure they have a positive impact.

The involvement of university volunteers will not only provide essential support for the children in the coding class but also offer a valuable opportunity for volunteers to develop their skills and contribute to the community, even if they are unable to be physically present. This partnership will allow our university to demonstrate its commitment to social impact and encourage students to become more engaged in social issues.
